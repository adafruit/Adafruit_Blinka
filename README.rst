This repository contains a selection of packages emulating the CircuitPython API
for devices or hosts running CPython or MicroPython. Working code exists to emulate these CircuitPython packages:

* **analogio** - analog input/output pins, using pin identities from board+microcontroller packages
* **bitbangio** - software-driven interfaces for I2C, SPI
* **board** - breakout-specific pin identities
* **busio** - hardware-driven interfaces for I2C, SPI, UART
* **digitalio** - digital input/output pins, using pin identities from board+microcontroller packages
* **keypad** - support for scanning keys and key matrices
* **microcontroller** - chip-specific pin identities
* **micropython** - MicroPython-specific module
* **neopixel_write** - low-level interface to NeoPixels
* **pulseio** - contains classes that provide access to basic pulse IO (PWM)
* **pwmio** - contains classes that provide access to basic pulse IO (PWM)
* **rainbowio** - provides the colorwheel() function
* **usb_hid** - act as a hid-device using usb_gadget kernel driver

For details, see the `Blinka API reference
<https://circuitpython.readthedocs.io/projects/blinka/en/latest/index.html>`_.

Dependencies
=============

The emulation described above is intended to provide a
CircuitPython-like API for devices which are running CPython or
Micropython. Since corresponding packages should be built-in to any
standard CircuitPython image, they have no value on a device already
running CircuitPython and would likely conflict in unhappy ways.

The test suites in the test/src folder under **testing.universal** are by design
intended to run on *either* CircuitPython *or* CPython/Micropython+compatibility layer to prove conformance.

Installing from PyPI
=====================

On supported GNU/Linux systems like the Raspberry Pi, you can install the driver locally `from
PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/Adafruit-Blinka/>`_. To install for current user:

.. code-block:: shell

    pip3 install Adafruit-Blinka

To install system-wide (this may be required in some cases):

.. code-block:: shell

    sudo pip3 install Adafruit-Blinka

To install in a virtual environment in your current project:

.. code-block:: shell

    mkdir project-name && cd project-name
    python3 -m venv .env
    source .env/bin/activate
    pip3 install Adafruit-Blinka

Usage Example
=============

At the time of writing (`git:7fc1f8ab <https://github.com/cefn/Adafruit_Micropython_Blinka/tree/7fc1f8ab477124628a5afebbf6826005955805f9>`_),
the following sequence runs through some basic testing of the digitalio compatibility layer...

.. code-block:: python

    from testing import test_module_name
    test_module_name("testing.universal.digitalio")

An example log from running the suites is `here <https://github.com/cefn/Adafruit_Micropython_Blinka/issues/2#issuecomment-366713394>`_ .

Building locally
================

Sphinx documentation
-----------------------

Sphinx is used to build the documentation based on rST files and comments in the code. First,
install dependencies (feel free to reuse the virtual environment from above):

.. code-block:: shell

    python3 -m venv .env
    source .env/bin/activate
    pip install Sphinx sphinx-rtd-theme Adafruit-PlatformDetect

Now, once you have the virtual environment activated:

.. code-block:: shell

    cd docs
    sphinx-build -E -W -b html . _build/html

This will output the documentation to ``docs/_build/html``. Open the index.html in your browser to
view them. It will also (due to -W) error out on any warning like Travis will. This is a good way to
locally verify it will pass.
